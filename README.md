# Jeff's 2023 Reactathon Talk

This repo contains the following assets:

- [The script for the talk](script.md) - It was not presented live as a verbatim read, but it was pretty close. I practiced this a lot, and also had a stage monitor with the notes on it to help with cues. I have done talks without scripts before, but have found that a script helps me stay on track, focused, and within talk time limits and does the best job at packing in the highest volume of useful information in the shortest time.
- [The slides themselves, as a website](website) - Responsive, portable, and works everywhere. IMO this is the best format to output a presentation. Use the arrow keys to navigate through the slides. It is [deployed here](https://jeff-reactathon-2023.vercel.app/) so you can see how it looks live.
- [The live demo](live-code-demo) - A short and somewhat silly demo added to the talk mostly just for the sake of doing a live demo, since I always do these in my talks. Goes through the basics of the react fetch cache.

This talk was given at Reactathon in San Fransisco on Tuesday May 2nd, 2023. It was generated using [iA Presenter](https://ia.net/presenter), which I was using for the first time but really enjoyed.
